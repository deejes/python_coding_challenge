### README

The problem is statement in assignment.md

I have implemented 2 different iterations of my solution.

While doing iteration1, I thought of some ways in which my solution could be improved. I wanted a working model first, and then later I implemented additional features in iteration2. 

There are markdown files in both folders in which I explain my approach to, limitations of, and thoughts about the solutions I have implemented.
 
To run either solution, execute main.py. The number of workers can be changed by editing variables declared at the beginning of main.py. 

Also, I have set the logging frequency to be 5 seconds instead of a minute to give more visibility into what is happening. This can be changed in the last line of info_logger.py

Dependencies are in requirements.txt, and I have used python27.
