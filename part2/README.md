### README

There are 2 solutions for Part2, iteration 1 and 2. 

While doing iteration1, I thought of some ways in which my solution could be improved. I wanted a working model though, but afterwards being somewhat invested in the problem, I carried on and implemented iteration2. There are markdown files in both folders in which I explain my approach to, limitations of, and thoughts about the solutions I have implemented.
 
To run either of the solutions, just execute main.py. The number of workers can be changed by editing variables declared at the beginning of main.py. 

Also, I have set the logging frequency to be 5 seconds instead of a minute to give more visibility into what is happening. This can be changed in the last line of info_logger.py

Dependencies are in requirements.txt, and I have used python27.
